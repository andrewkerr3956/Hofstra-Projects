        /* Q: What happens? Do you understand why? 
        Answer: The loop only runs once. It only runs once since the dowhile
        loop is guaranteed to iterate at least once.
        Q: What happens now? Would this be different with a while loop? How
        and why?
        Answer: The loop iterates several times. Yes because with a while loop
        you wouldn't be able to iterate at least once every single time; while
        loop will only iterate if the condition stays true. */
