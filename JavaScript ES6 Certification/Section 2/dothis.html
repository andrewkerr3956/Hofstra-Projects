    /* Q1: Why do you think the output appear the way it does?
    Answer: The output appears with the variable names instead of 
    the value of the variables because the variable name is contained
    in a string, which will make whatever is contained in the string
    display as the output (it's a string literal) 
    (in this case, the variable names).
    
    Q2: What does this tell you about double quotes in JavaScript?
    Answer: This tells us that double quotes will not display the contents
    of a variable, even if you put the variable in the string, it will instead
    return the variable name since it is a string literal. */
