            The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and Hyperledger will combine forces
            to create an open-source, standards-based cross-platform project to
            bring businesses distributed ledger solutions. "At Hyperledger, we're
            very focused at building communities that build a set of software
            products and many of those touch on and implement Ethereum-related
            standards, and the EEA is focused on driving a community of
            organizations around a common set of standards and then certifying
            applications against those standards," says EEA Executive
            Director Ron Resnick.
