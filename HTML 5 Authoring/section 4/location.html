    <h2>Franklin Square, NY</h2>
    <p>Franklin Square, NY is my hometown and where I currently reside. I've grown up here, went to school here, etc. My elementary school was very close to my house and it was
        called John Street School, and I have to say it was a pretty good school. My high school, H. Frank Carey High School, was also nearby and great. Then, finally, I went to
        Nassau Community College, which went remote during my second semester there due to COVID-19, for 2 years to get an Associates in IT, and now I'm graduated and moving on 
        to the next stage of my life. Therefore, my hometown is very significant to me because it's where most of my advancements in life took place.
