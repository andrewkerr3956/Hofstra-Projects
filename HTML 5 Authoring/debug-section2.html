    <h2>Written By Majorie Maddox</h2>
    <p>Dreams brimming over,<br />
        childhood stretched out in legs,<br />
        this is the moment replayed on winter days<br />
        when frost covers the field,<br />
        when age steals away wishes.<br />
        Glorious sleep that seeps back there<br />
        to the glory of our baseball days.</p>
