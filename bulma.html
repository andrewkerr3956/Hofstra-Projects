        The school bus is a very iconic vehicle used to transport students to their school in the morning, and drop them <br />
        off to their stop later on so that they can go home.

        This is the car that I drive. I think it's a great car and it looks pretty nice and wasn't too expensive. <br />
        I got it from a mechanic that was selling used cars for about $4,000, which I think was an amazing price. <br />
        It still runs good.
